## Featured Projects

### [Project 1: AI Generated Image Detection Challenge]

 AI Generated Image Detection model contains a tensorflow based model and a XGBoost based model. It aims to tell whether an image is AI generated or not.

- Goal: Implemented a predictive model that embibes the knowledge of Ai-Generated images, and uses them to predict the
label of a random image at test time
- Approach: Used CNN to achieve the results and also used XGBoosting to the difference in accuracy
- Result: The Max accuracy of 96% was achieved on the test dataset while training. The max accuracy of 88% was
achieved on the testing dataset on the unknown dataset

### [Project 2: Deep Learning-based Image Analysis of SDSS Galaxy Data]

- Goal: To perform classification on the Galaxy10 Dataset
- Approach: Employed a Varitational AutoEncoders to downsample the image and the output was feed to a Deep CNN to
perform classifcation.

### [Project 4: Autonomous Driven Vehicle(ADV)]

Developing a autonomous Vehicle which could run on its own without any assistance.
- Ongoing project under the guidance of Dr.Balasubramanian Raman, focused on self-driving technologies.
- Developed a 3D car model in Webots, integrating our institute's map and equipping it with distance sensors and cameras
for environment perception.
- Current Progress: Applying R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) to train the vehicle for object detection
and recognition tasks
-Future plans: Implementing the trained model into a miniature car embedded with LIDAR sensors for real-world testing
and validation.
- Position: Lead Computer Vision Team

### [Project 5: Chess Engine]

Currently trying to develope a chess engine in python.
- Goal: - Create a chess engine and a chess bot 
- Approch: - Draw the sprites on the screen, make the sprites move, calculate the moves for each piece. 
- Library: - Pygame
